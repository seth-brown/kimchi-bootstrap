cabbage 1.0 
red chili flakes        0.5 Cup
ginger  2.0 Tbsp

water   0.8 Cup

asian chives    4.0

```
2. Brinning
Make up a 1:10 v/v solution of Korean sea salt in water. A good starting volume is ~1.5L of this salt bath solution per one napa cabbage. Quarter the cabbage so that the leaves remain intact. Bath each quarter of cabbage in the salt bath, shake dry, and side aside in another bowl. Next, sprinkle ~2/3 cup of salt distributed evenly between each quarter of cabbage between each leaf of each quarter. (You use 2/3C of salt in total per whole cabbage, not 2/3C for each cabbage quarter). Start at the outside and work inward. After the salt has been applied to all leaves, return the cabbage to the salt water bath for ~4-8 hours. Turn cabbage once/hour to ensure all pieces get sufficiently brined. Once the brinning has finished, rinse the cabbage 2x in cold water, shake dry, and quarter into uniform pieces. Exclude the stem.

3. Prep
Mix glutinous rice powder with water and simmer over low heat until it thickens into a gel. Set this mixture aside to cool. Meanwhile, in another bowl combine the following ingredients:  
    * Korean red chili pepper flakes
    * grated ginger
    * minced garlic
    * water
    * gochujang
    * salted shrimp or anchovy paste (optional)

    After the mixture above has been homogenized, add the following ingredients:  
    * Korean radish (matchsticks)
    * carrots (matchsticks)
    * green onions (2" pieces)
    * asian chives (2" pieces)
    * glutinous rice gel

    Combine all ingredients and pour over cabbage. Ensure all leaves are sufficiently covered, then transfer to an appropriate container for fermentation. Taste after 3 days and onward until the desired flavor is reached.
